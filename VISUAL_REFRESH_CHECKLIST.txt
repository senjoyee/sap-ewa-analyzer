EWA Analyzer – Visual Refresh Checklist (Step-by-Step)
Date: 2025-08-24
Primary UX intent: Primarily Read reports; Upload is a secondary but frequent task. Chat is invoked ad‑hoc (modal), not persistent. Statuses (Good/Fair/Poor) are qualitative. Export/Share does not need constant prominence. Brand guidelines unknown (allow proposing a light micro‑brand). No strict WCAG target, but maintain good readability and contrast.

Format: Each step lists Objectives, What "Done" Looks Like, and Deliverables. Use this as an execution tracker.

0) Orientation and Success Criteria
[ ] Objective: Align stakeholders on the visual goals and guardrails.
    • Done looks like: One-page brief with goals (calm reading-first UI, modern surfaces, simplified actions), audience, and constraints.
    • Deliverables: 1‑page brief; before/after reference screenshots.

PHASE 1 — Foundations (Theme, Grid, Spacing, Typography)
1) Establish Micro‑brand (fallback visual language)
[ ] Objective: Define a lightweight palette, radius, elevation, and neutral ramps suitable for a calm, content-first UI.
    • Done looks like: Color tokens with a primary brand blue used sparingly; soft neutral surfaces; 6–8px corner radius; gentle shadows; subtle dividers.
    • Deliverables: Palette swatches (primary, neutral ramp, semantic: success/warn/danger/info), radius/elevation spec.

2) Spacing & Grid System
[ ] Objective: Adopt a consistent spacing scale and a responsive grid.
    • Done looks like: 4/8/12/16 spacing scale; 12‑column grid; consistent gutters; clear vertical rhythm across panels and sections.
    • Deliverables: Grid overlays on key screens; spacing guide with examples.

3) Type Scale & Hierarchy
[ ] Objective: Clarify headings, section titles, body, and meta text for reading.
    • Done looks like: 4–5 levels (Display/H1/H2/Body/Caption) with comfortable line-height and max line length (60–75 chars). Section subtitles styled as muted meta.
    • Deliverables: Type specimen sheet; updated section/header styles on the report.

PHASE 2 — Shell & App Bar
4) Top App Bar Simplification
[ ] Objective: Reduce visual noise and prioritize the product title.
    • Done looks like: Title with generous padding; secondary icons grouped in an overflow; aligned hit areas; subdued background.
    • Deliverables: App bar mock with overflow pattern; icon and spacing spec.

PHASE 3 — Left Rail (File Management)
5) Harmonize Rail Cards
[ ] Objective: Make "Upload files" and "Uploaded files" visually consistent.
[ ] Done looks like: Identical card shells (radius, shadow, header style). Title + helper text pattern. Even vertical spacing between cards.
    • Deliverables: Card header style (icon, title, subtext), spacing tokens.

6) Control Grouping for Bulk Actions
[ ] Objective: Convert scattered buttons into a coherent toolbar/segmented control.
    • Done looks like: "Expand all", "Collapse all", "Select all", "Deselect all" grouped; primary vs secondary emphasis clear; compact density.
    • Deliverables: Toolbar layout mock; hover/pressed states sheet.

7) Accordion Headers with Context
[ ] Objective: Improve scannability of file groups.
    • Done looks like: Chevron + title + count chip (e.g., 5 PDFs, 2 processed); consistent hit area; aligned icons.
    • Deliverables: Header pattern spec; examples for multiple groups.

PHASE 4 — Upload Experience (secondary but frequent)
8) Upload Card CTA & Helper Text
[ ] Objective: Present one clear primary action and supportive context.
    • Done looks like: Primary "Browse files" CTA; light cloud illustration/icon; concise helper text; reduced chroma.
    • Deliverables: Card mock with empty state; icon treatment.

9) File Intake Feedback
[ ] Objective: Show immediate, unobtrusive feedback on selection and readiness to process.
    • Done looks like: After selection, filenames appear with subtle chips for size/date; clear secondary action to Process when applicable.
    • Deliverables: Intake row pattern; feedback micro-states.

PHASE 5 — Uploaded File List (Rows)
10) Row Affordance & Actions
[ ] Objective: Replace tiny icon-only controls with a clearer row interaction model.
    • Done looks like: Clickable row area (thumbnail/extension, filename), right‑aligned action cluster (process/delete/more); consistent height; hover background.
    • Deliverables: Row anatomy; iconography set; hover/active states.

11) Metadata Presentation
[ ] Objective: Improve scan with compact, readable metadata.
    • Done looks like: Filename on first line; second line shows size • date • status chip; optional zebra striping or soft dividers.
    • Deliverables: Metadata style guide; truncation/wrap rules.

PHASE 6 — Report Header (Main Content)
12) Title, Meta Row, and Actions
[ ] Objective: Create a strong yet calm header that prioritizes reading.
    • Done looks like: Report title (H1), metadata row beneath (Analysis period, Overall risk as chip), subtle divider; export/share hidden in overflow or tertiary spot.
    • Deliverables: Header mock; chip spec for risk levels.

PHASE 7 — System Health Overview (Statuses)
13) Status Chips in Table
[ ] Objective: Replace long color bars with concise semantic chips.
    • Done looks like: Table with Area + Status chip (Good/Fair/Poor); consistent color ramp and icons; balanced column widths; reduced border weight.
    • Deliverables: Status chip scale (colors, icons); table specimen with zebra and sticky header.

PHASE 8 — Executive Summary (Readability)
14) Chunking & Callouts
[ ] Objective: Turn dense paragraphs into readable bullet groups with highlights.
    • Done looks like: Short bullet clusters with mini‑headings; critical risks in subtle callout cards; improved line-height.
    • Deliverables: Summary layout mock; callout card style.

PHASE 9 — Other Tables (Positive Findings, etc.)
15) Uniform Table Language
[ ] Objective: Standardize headers, padding, alignment, and multiline cells.
    • Done looks like: Consistent header weight; left-aligned cells; comfortable row height; multiline bullets rendered clearly; optional "Show more" expanders for very long cells.
    • Deliverables: Table guidelines; examples with long content.

PHASE 10 — Document Assistant (Ad‑hoc Chat)
16) Modal Chat (invoked ad‑hoc)
[ ] Objective: Provide a focused chat as a modal, not persistent side‑sheet.
    • Done looks like: Centered or side modal with scrim, sticky header, and always-visible input area; rich empty state with a single CTA ("Process file").
    • Deliverables: Modal layout; empty state illustration/message; CTA copy.

PHASE 11 — Customer Assignment Overlay
17) Guided Step Card / Small Modal
[ ] Objective: Make selection fast and obvious for up to ~50 items.
    • Done looks like: Title + short description; searchable combobox with clear options (optional avatars/icons); selection confirmation as a chip/pill; normalized paddings.
    • Deliverables: Small modal/card mock; combobox interaction notes.

PHASE 12 — Buttons & Icons
18) Action Hierarchy & Consistency
[ ] Objective: One primary per view; neutrals for secondary/tertiary.
    • Done looks like: Primary reserved for the main task (e.g., Process when applicable, otherwise none in read mode); secondary buttons are subtle/ghost; icon-only actions all have labels (tooltips), consistent size and family.
    • Deliverables: Button matrix (states, sizes); iconography inventory and replacements (single style family).

PHASE 13 — Color & Status System
19) Semantic Color Ramp
[ ] Objective: Calm, readable status communication without harsh slabs.
    • Done looks like: Chips, small progress where needed; backgrounds remain primarily neutral; consistent success/warn/danger/info hues.
    • Deliverables: Semantic color sheet with sample components.

PHASE 14 — Micro‑interactions & Motion
20) Subtle Motion and Focus
[ ] Objective: Add polish without distraction.
    • Done looks like: 150–200ms ease transitions on rows, chips, buttons; visible focus outlines; gentle elevation on overlays.
    • Deliverables: Motion spec; focus states sheet.

PHASE 15 — Responsive Behavior
21) Breakpoints & Adaptations
[ ] Objective: Ensure excellent reading on narrow viewports.
    • Done looks like: Left rail collapses under ~1024px into a drawer; chat modal becomes full‑width on small screens; tables offer horizontal scroll with edge shadows and sticky headers/first column.
    • Deliverables: Responsive mocks at key breakpoints; table overflow patterns.

PHASE 16 — Review & Polish
22) Density and Contrast Audit
[ ] Objective: Tune spacing, dividers, and contrast for comfort.
    • Done looks like: Consistent section spacing; dividers used sparingly; text contrast comfortable even without strict WCAG targets; blue reduced to accents.
    • Deliverables: Before/after compare board; final style snapshot.

23) Readability Validation
[ ] Objective: Validate that reading remains the primary, least-effort task.
    • Done looks like: Users can scan the report quickly; actions don’t compete with content; export/share is discoverable but not dominant.
    • Deliverables: Heuristic review notes; small user feedback sample if available.

Execution Notes
• Prioritize phases 1, 6, 7, and 14 to make the biggest impact on reading quality quickly.
• Retain current structure where possible; this is a visual refresh, not an IA rewrite.
• For statuses (Good/Fair/Poor), define only visual semantics (color/icon) since thresholds are qualitative.
• Since export/share isn’t critical, tuck into overflow in the report header.
• Brand is flexible—start with a soft micro‑brand; keep tokens easy to swap if brand guidance arrives later.
